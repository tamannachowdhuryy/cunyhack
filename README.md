This project aims to simplify the process of creating a class schedule for computer science college students. It provides an intuitive interface for users to input their specific requirements and preferences regarding computer science classes, math classes, and common core requirements. The generator then produces a personalized class schedule, incorporating both user-provided choices and randomly selected classes that fulfill common core requirements.

This project is based on the course selections at CUNY Hunter College for a student majoring in computer science.

##Features
**User Input:** Easily input computer science classes, math classes, and common core requirements.
**Customization:** Tailor the generated schedule to match individual preferences and academic needs.
**Random Selection:** Automatically selects one or two classes from a predefined list based on common core requirements.
**Calendar Display:** Presents the generated class schedule in a visually appealing calendar format on a webpage.
